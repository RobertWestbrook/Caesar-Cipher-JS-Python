# Caesar-Cipher-JS-Python
Cipher generator created JavaScript and in Python to code and decode messages. Mostly developed as a fun project the only cipher translation that is currently supported is Rot13. This cipher is available in both JS and Python for a wider variety of applications. 

# Use:
- This can be run as a simple Python application in Python shell by importing py file like so:`from Casear import *` Then calling the function of choice. (Currently the only cipher available is rot13)so you would call it like so: `rot13(<'message you want encoded'>)` In order to decipher you would call the function and pass the encoded message as the parameter. 
- There is a simple GUI for this interface. The message section of this interface is where you will place the message that you would like encoded or decoded and it will show up in real time on the translation. 
### *The GUI is a PyQt5 application, so it may require you to download PyQt5 in order to run it.*

# TO DO:
- Generate more ciphers for a wider variety of message encryption. 
- Add necessary support to the GUI for the Python program to allow for selection between multiple ciphers.
- Create a mobile application utilizing the code.
- Package the app.
